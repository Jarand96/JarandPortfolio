I live in a way too small apartement with my wife and dog. </br></br> When I'm not making the internet I tend to travel a lot. I really like meeting different people and seeing new places. I also enjoy making movies, drinking lots of coffee and playing football.</p></div></div><div class="hero passion"><div class="imghandler"><img src="/assets/img/inspor.jpg"/></div><div class="descriptionhandler"><h3>Passion & Planning</h3><p>I started doing design and front-end development about six months ago, and I absolutely love it!</br></br> I attend meetups as often as possible, but sadly there are not many available in my area. This spring I plan on starting up a monthly meetup for webdevelopers in Aust-Agder. Send me an email if you're interested!</p></div></div><div class="hero profession"><div class="imghandler"><img src="/assets/img/tsoc.jpg"/></div><div class="descriptionhandler"><h3>Education & Experience</h3><p>I studied computer engineering at University of Agder. I learned a whole lot and got to work on some pretty dank projects. For my final research project I made a VOIP-App for Windows.</br></br> I'm currently working as a IT-security analyst, and doing my best to stop hackers from breaking in places.</p></div></div></div></div></section>
